# Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the temperatures between summer and winter season.  We are comparing these seasons because we know the company can be profitable in the summer, however if the temperatures within the winter season are too low there will be very few customers.
# Results: 
* The maximum temperature for June and December is surprisingly only a two degrees in difference. 
* There are significantly more temperatures to account for in June than in December. 
* The mean temperature for both June and December are both around seventy degrees in temperature.  
# Summary: 
The business can be profitable year round as the temperature difference between seasons is minimal.  There are points within December that the temperature will be low enough that there will be no business.  For this business model we would need to create incentives to increase traffic signficantly within the summer months.  
1. I would perform an analysis on the temperature data for the month of January to see if traffic for the store would increase after the decrease in December.  

2. I would ask the owner what month they wanted to open the store and run an analysis on the temperatures for that month.
